##	PREREQUISITE 

###	Node.js 
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.

### npm 
When you install node.js, npm is automatically installed. However, npm gets updated more frequently than Node.js, so be sure that you have the latest version.

## Installation


### Dependency

Run `npm install` for installing dependency.


## Run server

Run `npm run start`. Navigate to `http://localhost:8081/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
